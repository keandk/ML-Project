Path equivalence involves the\n use of special characters in file and directory names. The associated\n manipulations are intended to generate multiple names for the same\n object. This test will accept input of a file to read, but prohibits access\n to file in the /etc directory. The input generates an equivalent name\n /////etc/////passwd which bypasses the filter.\nMetadata\n - Base program: Elastic Search\n - Source Taint: SOCKET\n - Data Type: ARRAY\n - Data Flow: JAVA_GENERICS\n - Control Flow: BREAK_WITH_LABEL","dependencies":["stonesoup-vm-v3.0","elasticsearch-v1.0.0"],"submissionDate":"2015-10-06"},"taxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","taxa":[{"id":"41","name":"Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence"}],"version":"4.6","downloadUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/xml/cwec_v4.6.xml.zip","organization":"MITRE","informationUri":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/published/cwe_v4.6.pdf","isComprehensive":false,"shortDescription":{"text":"The MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration"}}]}],"$schema":"https://json.schemastore.org/sarif-2.1.0.json","version":"2.1.0"}},{"download":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/downloads/versions/156875-v1.0.0.zip","link":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/test-cases/156875/versions/1.0.0","identifier":"156875-v1.0.0","sarif":{"runs":[{"tool":{"driver":{"name":"SARD - SAMATE","version":"5.0.0","fullName":"Software Assurance Reference Dataset Project","organization":"NIST","informationUri":"https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/","supportedTaxonomies":[{"name":"CWE","index":0}]}},"results":[{"taxa":[{"id":"36","index":0,"toolComponent":{"name":"CWE","index":0}}],"ruleId":"CWE-36","message":{"text":"Absolute Path Traversal."},"locations":[{"physicalLocation":{"region":{"endLine":382,"startLine":379},"artifactLocation":{"uri":"src/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/packed/BulkOperation.java","index":1}}}]}],"artifacts":[{"hashes":{"sha-256":"1662b993120a73522785bca9e6d729c5af620c820399ce81863564a9c5e07c2c"},"length":55366,"location":{"uri":"J-C036A-LUCE-06-ST03-DT03-DF18-CF25-01.xml"},"sourceLanguage":"xml"},{"hashes":{"sha-256":"cd982e3c61b9fe909557d966a7f1b25870dd2c7ecc678f14eaa54a8c1645b660"},"length":18142,"location":{"uri":"src/core/src/java/org/apache/lucene/util/packed/BulkOperation.java"},"sourceLanguage":"java"}],"properties":{"id":156875,"type":"source code","state":"bad","author":"IARPA STONESOUP Test and Evaluation team","status":"candidate","version":"1.0.0","language":"java","application":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:lucene:4.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","description":"The software uses external input to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not neutralize absolute path sequences such as '/abs/path' that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.
